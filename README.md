Time travelling made simple.

#### Dear Friend,
If I may, I wish to propose to you a notion, no, an idea!

The idea that although some process, procedure or code of your own design may well function as expected in the
here and now, that no guarantees can be made with certainty that the same will function as well tomorrow.

And furthermore, some aspect of the device so thoughtfully rendered by yourself may by it's very nature be sensitive
to the natural forces of time. What I'm saying, my dear friend, is that you may expect the product to be varied given
the variable of the time of it's execution.

Now, I ask you this question, although no answer will be necessary, I assure you. How does one ensure the quality and
stability of their creations if one of the most basic and unchangeable variables of the universe can alter it's very
behavior?

Friend, I have for you, a bonafide, verifiable solution to this very problem. What you see before you is a device by
which the constructions of your invention can be sent through time to execute their tasks and produce their results
only to safely return at your immediate command.

You seem skeptical, friend, and understandably so. If I may provide a simple demonstration of this device I believe
you will find yourself convinced, and in short time a master of time travel yourself.

First, acquire the device using the system of your choice. I recommend:

    $pip install herbert

Now, once the device is installed you can begin executing commands immediately!
